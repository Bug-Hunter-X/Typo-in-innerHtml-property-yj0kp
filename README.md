# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHtml Typo
This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML/JavaScript: a typo in the `innerHTML` property.

The bug lies in the `innerHtml` typo.  The corrected version uses `innerHTML`.

## Bug Description
A simple typo in the `innerHTML` property can lead to unexpected behavior and silently fail.  This example shows how a missing 'H' can cause the script to not execute correctly, making it difficult to trace.
